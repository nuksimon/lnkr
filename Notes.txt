LnkLnkr is a visual way to learn.  
Searches return a draggable window with an iconic image and title
They are also full of information directly from Wikipedia

We highlight the most relevant links within the article
And pull out any tagged metadata

Clicking a link will open a new window and draw a line between them, 
	so you can literally see the connection

Open multiple windows to build a mind map view 
	and understand the interconnectedness of the articles

Zoom out and drag the background to get a high level view

Use the Timeline to understand the historical relationship

Re-arange articles on the screen and learn about new topics

Different display settings will help you visually manage the content

And most importantly, have fun learning!
